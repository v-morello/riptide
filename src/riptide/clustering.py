    Find clusters in one dimensional data using a simple friends of friends

    Parameters
    ----------
    x : ndarray
        Input data
    r : float
        Clustering radius
    already_sorted : bool, optional

    -------
    clusters : list
        List of clusters. Each cluster is an array of indices of points in 'x'
