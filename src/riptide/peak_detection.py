):
    """
    Identify significant peaks in a periodogram using a dynamically fitted
    S/N selection threshold. The fitting involves the following procedure for
    each pulse width trial separately:

    1. Cut the frequency range covered by the periodogram in segments
       of length 1 / T_obs
    2. Get the median S/N 'm' and robust S/N standard deviation 's' of each
       segment. The dynamic selection threshold for that segment should be
       t = m + nstd x s
    3. Fit a polynomial in log(f) to the control points (f_i, t_i) thus
       obtained
    4. Any point whose S/N exceeds both the dynamic threshold and the value
       'smin' are considered significant
    5. Cluster these points. Two points are in the same peak if their
       trial frequencies are within clrad / T_obs of each other. All such
       clusters constitute a Peak.

    Parameters
    ----------
    pgram : Periodogram
        Input periodogram to search for peaks
    smin : float, optional
        Minimum S/N that a peak must exceed, in addition to having to exceed
        the dynamic selection threshold
    segwidth : float, optional
        Width of a frequency segment in units of 1 / T_obs
    nstd : float, optional
        See above for an explanation
    minseg : float, optional
        Minimum number of segments below which only a static selection
        threshold is applied
    polydeg : float, optional
        Degree of polynomial in log(f)
    clrad : float, optional
        Clustering radius in frequency space, in units of 1 / T_obs
